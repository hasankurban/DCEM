\title{means_mv: Part of DCEM package.}
\usage{
means_mv(data, num_means)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{(matrix): The dataset provided by the user (converted to matrix format).}

\item{num_means}{(numeric): The number of means (meu).}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the randomly selected samples from the dataset. The inital
means will be updated during the iterations of the algorithm.
}
\description{
Initialize the mean(s) for the Gaussian(s) by randomly selecting
the samples from the dataset.
}
\examples{
# Generate random samples from a multivariate distribution.
sample_data = MASS::mvrnorm(n=10, rep(10,5), Sigma = diag(5))

# Get the mean(s) from the data
means_mv(sample_data, num_means=2)
