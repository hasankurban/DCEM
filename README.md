**Package Overview**

Implements the Expectation Maximisation Algorithm for clustering the multivariate and univariate datasets. The package has been tested with numerical datasets (not recommended for categorical/ordinal data). The package comes bundled with a dataset for demonstration (ionosphere_data.csv). More help about the package can be seen by typing `?DCEM` in the R console (after installing the package).

**Currently, data imputation is not supported and user has to handle the missing data before using the package.**

**Installation Instructions**

**_Installing from CRAN_**

```
install.packages(dcem)
```

**_Installing from the Binary Package_**

```
install.packages(dcem_1.0.0.tgz, repos = NULL, type="source")
```

**How to use the package (An Example: working with the default bundled dataset)**

- The dcem package comes bundled with the ionosphere_data.csv for demostration. Help about the dataset can be seen by typing `?ionosphere_data` in the R console. Additional details can be seen at the link [Ionosphere data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ionosphere)

- To use this dataset, paste the following code into the R console.

```
ionosphere_data = read.csv2(
  file = paste(trimws(getwd()),"/data/","ionosphere_data.csv",sep = ""),
  sep = ",",
  header = FALSE,
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

- **_Cleaning the data_**: Before the model can be trained (`dcem_train()` function), the data must be cleaned. This simply means to remove all redundant columns (example can be label column). This dataset contains labels in the last column (35th) and only 0's in the 2nd column so let's remove them,

Paste the below code in the R session to clean the dataset.

```
ionosphere_data =  trim_data("35,2", ionosphere_data)
```

- **_Clustering the data:_** The dcem_train() learns the parameters of the Gaussian(s) from the input data. It internally calls the `dcem_cluster_mv()`or `dcem_cluster_uv()` function for multivariate and univariate data respectively. These 
functions assign(s) the probabilistic weights to the sample(s) in the dataset. 

Paste the below code in the R session to call the dcem_train() function.

```
dcem_out = dcem_train(data = ionosphere_data, threshold = 0.0001, iteration_count = 50, num_clusters = 2)
```

- **_Accessing the output:_** The list returned by the `dcem_train()` is stored in the **_dcem_out_** object. It contains the parameters associated with the clusters (Gaussian(s)). These parameters are namely - posterior probabilities, mean, co-variance (multivariate data) or standard-deviation (univariate data) and priors. Paste the following code in the R session to access any/all the output parameters. 

``` 
          [1] Posterior Probabilities: `**dcem_out$prob**`: A matrix of posterior-probabilities for the 
              points in the dataset.
              
          [2] Mean(s): `**dcem_out$mean**`
              
              For multivariate data: It is a matrix of means for the gaussians. Each row in the  
              matrix corresponds to a mean for the gaussian.
              
              For univariate data: It is a vector if means. Each element of the vector corresponds 
              to one gaussian.
              
          [3] Co-variance matrices 
          
              For multivariate data: `**dcem_out$cov**`: list of co-variance matrices for the gaussians.
          
              For univariate data: Standard-deviation `**dcem_out$sd**`: vector of standard deviation(s) 
              for the gaussians.
               
          [4] Priors: `**dcem_out$prior**`: a vector of priors for the gaussians.
```
