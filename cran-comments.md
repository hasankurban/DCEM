## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.3
* platform: x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0 
* arch: x86_64

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There were 2 note(s) during the check_rhub() and check_win_devel() process respectively. (No Notes generated by R CMD CHECK on the local development system). The first note was generated by check_rhub() only for the following:

Platform: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit

## Downstream dependencies
I have also run R CMD check on downstream dependencies and all packages passed the test.
